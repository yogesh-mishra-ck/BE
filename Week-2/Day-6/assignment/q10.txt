Question 10.
Difference between git fetch and git pull.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


git fetch is used to bring updates from a repository but they are not merged into mine local branch.
git pull also brings updates from a repository but this time automatically attempts to merge the changes from the remote branch into the current local branch.
