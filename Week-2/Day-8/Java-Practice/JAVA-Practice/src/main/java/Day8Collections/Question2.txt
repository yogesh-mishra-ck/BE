2. List the differences between Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet.

ArrayList is based on array meaning elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
In array if we want to add more elements dynamically, we need to manually create a new array  with larger size and copy previous elements
But in arraylist, this happens automatically when inserting a new element.

Hashset is used for storing only unique values
Order is not maintained in hashset

Vectors are synchronized which increases overhead.
Vectors are no longer used unless it's a legacy code

LinkedList
Elements are stored using references.
Each node has next and previous references.
Slow for searching
