Question 12.
Show the difference between git reset and git revert.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In git revert, a new branch is created with undo operation(undo the changes made by previous commit) so that we still have history of our branches
In git reset, the data cannot be recovered again, it is a permanent undo operation.
