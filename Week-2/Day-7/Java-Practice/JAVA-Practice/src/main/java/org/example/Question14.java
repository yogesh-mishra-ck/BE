//Exception Propagation (Method Chain)
//Write three methods (m1(), m2(), m3()):
//m1() calls m2(), and m2() calls m3().
//m3() divides by zero.
//Observe how the exception propagates up the chain and catch it in m1().
//Re-throw Exception
//Catch an exception inside a try-catch block, print a message,
//then re-throw it to be handled by another catch block at a higher level.
